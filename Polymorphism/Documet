Compile time polymorphism: Achieved through method overloading and operator overloading.

Runtime polymorphism: Achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides specific implementation
of a method already defined in its superclass.

Method/Costructor Overriding:

- Occurs when a subclass provides a sprcific implementation for a method already defined in its class.

\*Runtime polymorphism : Overriding is a basis for runtime polymorphism, where the method call is determined by the object's typw at runtime.

\*SuperClass reference : An overridden method can be called through a superclass reference holding a subclass object.

\*\* Overriding matlab method already super class mei defined hai pr hm apni class mei same method bnayenge to uss cheej ko @overridden annotaion se btate h ki yeh definition with same sigature super mei bhe h.

**Overridden methods must have the ame name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class.
**@Override annotation is optional but helps to ensure that the method is correctly overridden.

Final Keyword :
*Final Variable : To create constant variables
*Final Methods : To prevent method overriding
\*Final classes : To prevent inheritance.

\*\*Abstract and final can't be together
