Purpose :
 ExecutorService is a framework provided by the java concurrency API to manage and execute submitted tasks without the need to manually manage thread life cylces.

Thread Pool Management : 

ExecutorService efficiently reuses a fixed pool of threads to execute tasks, thereby improving pefrormance by reducing the overhead of thread creation, expecially for short-lived asynchronous tasks.
