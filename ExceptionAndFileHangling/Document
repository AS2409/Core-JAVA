What is Exception :

- In java an Exception is a disruptive event that occurs during the execution of a program interrupting its normal flow. It's
  an instance of a problem that arises while th program is running, such as arithmetic errors, null pointer access or resource overflows.

- Exceptions are objects in java that encapsulate information avout an error event, including its type and the state of the program when the error occured.

Try-Catch

\*Try block contains code that is susceptible to exceptions.

\*Catch block follows the try block and handles the exceptions thrown by the try block.

\*When an exception occurs in thr try block the control is transferred to the catch block, where the exception is handled.

\*\*Exception is the parent class of all the exceptions eg. ArithmeticException, IndexOutOfBoundException etc.

Type Of Exception :

1. User defined exception
2. Built in exception
   (i) Checked Exception : These are the exceptions that must be either caught or declared in the method (Inko handle krna padega hme.).
   (ii) Unchecked exception : These are the exceptions that are not need to be explicitly handled (jaruri nhi h handle krna hme).

\*\* There are two ways to handle exception i.e try-catch and throws (see in ThrowAndThrows).

Throw and Throws :

1. throws Keyword

- Is used to declare that i can throw the exception.
- Declares that a method may throw one of more exceptions.
- Used in the method signature to indicate that the method might throw exceptions of specified types
- A method declared with throws requires the calling method to handle or further declare the exception

2. throw Keyword

- Is used to actually throw the exception.

Finally Block 

finally :

  *Executes code after the try-catch, used mainly for cleanup operations.
  *Always runs regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught in the try-catch.
  *Ideal for closing resources like files or database connections to prevent resourece leak.
